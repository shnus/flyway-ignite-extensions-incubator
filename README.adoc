== Features

=== Dumper
As part of our experimental snapshot engine implementation, the Dumper provides snapshot related features. This allows users to create a complete or incremental schema snapshot. The Dumper can be accessed via a direct Java call, as shown in the example below, or through the command-line tool.

----
  Dumper dp = Dumper.configure()
                .setAddresses("localhost:4234")
                .load();

  SnapshotOperation result = dp.createFullSchemaSnapshot("test-snapshot-name");
